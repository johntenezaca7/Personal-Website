            <p className="tech-nar"><span id="tab">Alongside</span> my passion for creativity, I’ve also had an inclination towards figuring out how things worked behind the scenes. It was this coursity that led me towards building my own instruments, repairing audio equipment and now building full stack web applications. I’ve built applications that use either a NoSQL database or a SQL database, depending if we wanted flexibility or reliability. For the back-end, I’ve worked with Node.js for it’s asynchronous nature which allows for great speed and scalability. And for the front-end, my go to Javascript library is React. React focuses on being the “View” on the MVC architecture pattern and this forces use to view everything as UI components.This makes translating wireframes into React components fun and insticulal. With my experience in these technologies, I look forward to working with a team of engineers that share my diligent work ethic and a passion for building intuitive, interactive and invaluable web applications.</p>
