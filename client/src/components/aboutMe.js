             It was this coursity that led me towards building my own instruments, repairing audio equipment and now, building full stack web applications.<br />
            <span id="tab">I've</span> built applications that use either a NoSQL database or a SQL database, depending on the need for flexibility or reliability. For the back-end,
             I’ve worked with Node.js for it’s asynchronous nature, which allows for great speed and scalability. And for the front-end, my go to Javascript library is React. React 
             focuses on being the “View” on the MVC architecture pattern and this forces us to view everything as UI components. This makes translating wireframes into React components fun and instinctual.<br />
